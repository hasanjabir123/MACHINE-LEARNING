## üîç Types of Machine Learning

Machine Learning is generally classified into three main types:

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Supervised Learning
- Learns from labeled data (input-output pairs)
- Goal: Predict the output for new/unseen data
- **Examples**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Unsupervised Learning
- Works with **unlabeled data**
- Goal: Find hidden patterns or groupings in the data
- **Examples**:
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - Hierarchical Clustering
  - Apriori Algorithm

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Reinforcement Learning
- Learns by interacting with an environment
- Receives **rewards or penalties** based on actions
- Goal: Maximize cumulative rewards
- **Examples**:
  - Game-playing agents (like AlphaGo)
  - Robotics
  - Self-driving Cars
