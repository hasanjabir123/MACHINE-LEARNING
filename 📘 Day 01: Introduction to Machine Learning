## 🤖 What is Machine Learning?

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

---

## 🔍 Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning**
   - Input data (features) and output labels are provided.
   - Model learns to map input to output.
   - 📌 Examples: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees

2. **Unsupervised Learning**
   - Only input data is provided, no labels.
   - Model finds hidden patterns or groupings.
   - 📌 Examples: K-Means Clustering, PCA

3. **Reinforcement Learning**
   - An agent learns by interacting with the environment.
   - Uses rewards and penalties to learn optimal actions.
   - 📌 Examples: Game-playing agents, robotics

## 🧱 Basic Concepts

| Term               | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Dataset**        | Collection of data used to train/test the model |
| **Features**       | Input variables (independent variables) |
| **Labels/Targets** | Output variables (dependent variable) |
| **Model**          | A mathematical representation used to make predictions |
| **Training**       | Teaching the model using known data |
| **Testing**        | Evaluating model performance on unseen data |

## 🛠️ Common ML Workflow

1. Collect Data
2. Clean and Preprocess Data
3. Choose a Model
4. Train the Model
5. Evaluate the Model
6. Make Predictions

## ⚙️ Common Libraries in Python

- `pandas` – for data manipulation
- `numpy` – for numerical operations
- `matplotlib` / `seaborn` – for visualization
- `scikit-learn` – for machine learning models

## 📌 Why Learn ML?

- In-demand skill in tech industry
- Used in healthcare, finance, automation, marketing, etc.
- Powers technologies like chatbots, recommendation systems, and fraud detection
