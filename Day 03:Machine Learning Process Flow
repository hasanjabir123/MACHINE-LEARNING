🔁 Machine Learning Process Flow
1. Problem Definition
🔍 What are we trying to predict or solve?

Example: Predict house prices, detect spam emails, classify images.

2. Data Collection
📊 Gather relevant and high-quality data.

Sources: Databases, APIs, IoT sensors, web scraping, CSV files.

Example: Customer purchase history, medical records, sensor data.

3. Data Preprocessing
🧼 Clean and prepare the data.

Handle missing values

Remove duplicates

Encode categorical variables

Normalize/scale features

Split into training, validation, and test sets

4. Feature Engineering
🛠️ Select or create useful input features.

Select important columns (features)

Create new features (ex: total_price = qty × unit_price)

Reduce dimensionality (ex: PCA)

5. Model Selection
🧠 Choose the right ML algorithm.

Supervised: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, etc.

Unsupervised: K-Means, DBSCAN, etc.

Reinforcement: Q-Learning, DQN, etc.

6. Model Training
🚀 Feed the training data into the algorithm.

The model learns from patterns in the training data.

This involves optimizing internal parameters.

7. Model Evaluation
📈 Test the model's performance.

Use validation/test data to measure:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score (classification)

MSE, RMSE, R² (regression)

8. Hyperparameter Tuning
🔧 Fine-tune the model to improve performance.

Use Grid Search, Random Search, or Bayesian Optimization

Example: Adjusting the learning rate, number of trees, etc.

9. Deployment
🚀 Put the model into production.

Expose it via an API, embed in apps, or run on edge devices.

10. Monitoring and Maintenance
🔁 Track performance and retrain if needed.

Detect data drift, update the model periodically.
